        <p>Brief description about the project</p>
        <p>This web application takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they <br><br>were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.</p><br>
        <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given <br><br>their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they <br><br>were born. Here are Ghanian day names.</p><br>
